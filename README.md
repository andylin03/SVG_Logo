# Overview
# The Challenge
Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user inputs to generates a SVG logo and saves it as "logo.svg" file. In addition, create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and the passing of all of the tests.
# User Story
* AS a freelance web developer
* I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
* SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
# Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
* WHEN I am prompted for text
* THEN I can enter up to three characters
* WHEN I am prompted for the text color
* THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
* WHEN I am prompted for a shape
* THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
* WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
* THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
* WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
* THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
* AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
* WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
* THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
# Usage Instructions
1. Open the cloned repository in any source code editor e.g. Visual Studio Code.
2. Open integrated terminal on index.js
3. Enter “node index.js” in the command line
4. Through sequential order within the command line interface - the user will be presented with npm inquirer questions - the user will provide a response to each question and proceed.
5. Once completed a SVG file named "logo.svg" will be created.
6. At your discretion, you may rename the "logo.svg" file to the file name of your choice.
(Optional) Regarding future use, you may alter the prompted questions within the index.js to best suit your needs.

# Installation Process
Clone the repository: [SVG Logo](https://github.com/andylin03/SVG-Logo])

Install the following:
* [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.18.1)
* [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)
* [Inquirer.js: ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4)

Open the cloned repository in any source code editor.

Open the integrated terminal for the document and complete the respective installation guides provided above in section (2.) to ensure the cloned documentation will operate.

# Built With 
* Dynamic JavaScript
* [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.18.1)
* [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)
* [Inquirer.js: ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4)
* [Visual Studio Code:](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  # What I learned
* Create an non-deployed application that invokes a “node index.js” in the command line to generate a logo and save it as a SVG file.
* Learned the JavaScript testing framework "Jest".

  # Continued Development:
* Continue creating SVG files to practice
* Add more user prompts to create more possibilities among a rendered SVG image.
